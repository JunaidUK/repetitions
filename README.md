## [Repetitions](https://repetitions-bt.herokuapp.com/)
This application is my capstone project for Launch Academy. This application is meant to bring together like-minded athletes who want to run practice drills together. Repetitions a single-page web application built using React.js framework, on a Ruby on Rails back-end. I wanted to challenge myself to build all of my user interactions on React.js, create a streamlined experience for potential users.


### Build Status
[ ![Codeship Status for JunaidUK/repetitions](https://app.codeship.com/projects/f3bb0640-bdd4-0136-64dd-06db9786e066/status?branch=master)](https://app.codeship.com/projects/312963)

### Comments
 - This application is still being worked on. Due to some difficulties with version control using React.js and Material UI, I was unable to build out an extensive front-end testing suite that would test user interaction. There are basic feature test built out for my back-end features. An example of my work using Test Driven Development can be found here: [Muralis](https://github.com/MrBlooKangaroo/muralis)
 - I will be adding more robust seed data
